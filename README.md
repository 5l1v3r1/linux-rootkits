# Linux rootkits
This repo regroups my little precious collection of Linux 4.x kernel rootkits.

You will find some rootkits that I wrote and other publicly available rootkits that I adapted for the latest version of the Linux kernel.

These rootkits are meant to be used for educational purposes only.
